# DevSecOps Pipeline Project ðŸš€

This is our college project where we built a **DevSecOps CI/CD pipeline** using:

- **GitHub Actions** â†’ For automation
- **SonarCloud** â†’ For static code analysis
- **Snyk** â†’ For vulnerability scanning
- **Spring PetClinic (sample app)** â†’ Demo Java application to test our pipeline

## Project Objectives
- âœ… Automated code quality analysis  
- âœ… Vulnerability scanning
